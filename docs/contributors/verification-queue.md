# Verification queue

[D190](decisions/working-notes.md#d190--the-testing-strategy-devices-report-on-themselves-against-numbers-a-missing-capability-fails-every-check-first-shows-it-can-fail-and-the-lab-is-built-from-what-is-on-the-shelf)
requires every behaviour change to be able to turn a test red when reverted. A few cannot: the
symptom shows only on a device, a network or a room. For those, the change adds an item here,
someone does it, ticks it, and the commit carries `Verified-By: VQ<n>`.
`scripts/check_revert_red.py` refuses the trailer if the item is missing or unticked. yoloAI's
free-text trailer was never used, because nothing checked it.

**Format**, one line per item, IDs never reused:

```
- [ ] **VQ<n>** — <what to do, on which device, and what "passes" means> (<commit or branch>)
- [x] **VQ<n>** — … — done <date> by <who>: <what was seen>
```

An item is ticked only by the person who did it, and only with what they saw.

## Items

- [ ] **VQ1** — On devnas (J3455), run
  `go test -run '^$' -bench HashPassword -benchtime 10x ./internal/core/auth` and read
  `BenchmarkHashPassword_DefaultParameters`. Passes at 500 ms/op or less
  ([D194](decisions/working-notes.md#d194--secrets-our-users-passwords-are-hashed-third-party-secrets-are-sealed-with-a-key-that-never-enters-the-database-and-nothing-reads-a-secret-back-out)
  §2); above it, the memory cost comes down to OWASP's 46 MiB, t = 1. For reference, an
  i3-N305 VM measured 50 ms. (M1)
- [x] **VQ2** — In Firefox on the dev loop, play a prepared film or episode with sound in its
  centre (any dev-library MKV but the stereo ones), and tick and untick **Dialogue boost**
  while it plays. Passes when the change is heard within about a second of the click, with at
  most a moment's pause. Before this change it took two to four seconds whatever the segment
  length. (the seek after an audio switch in `web/packages/player/src/hls.ts`) — done
  2026-09-26 by the owner: *"Yup, works within about a second now."*
- [x] **VQ3** — On an Android phone in Chrome, and in desktop Firefox, on the dev loop, play
  **Remux Film (2021)** and choose **English** under **Subtitles**. Passes when the text
  appears over the picture, styled as its ASS says, inside the picture's area and not under the
  controls, within a few seconds of choosing it. Then press **Later** three times: the offset
  reads +0.3 s and the text moves at once, paused or playing. Leave and play the film again:
  it starts at +0.3 s. (JASSUB in `web/packages/player/src/subtitles.ts`) — done 2026-09-26 by the owner, on an Android phone in Chrome: *"Subtitles render, and I've
  observed the subtitles arriving later and earlier when I adjust the offset"*, and the offset
  was still set after the page reloaded. Desktop Firefox not yet seen.
- [x] **VQ4** — On an Android phone in Chrome, on the dev loop, play **Remux Film (2021)**, let it
  play past 0:20, pause, and leave the page. Play it again: it starts where it was paused, with no
  question asked. Then press **Start over**: it plays from 0:00. On a second device signed in as
  the same person, play it past 0:25 and leave; on the phone, play it again: it starts near 0:25,
  the later watching, not the earlier. (`web/apps/web/src/play-state.ts`) — done 2026-09-26 by the owner, on an
  Android phone in Chrome, after `5da8b69`: *"Yup works correctly with pause and without"*; the
  second device's part not yet seen.
- [x] **VQ5** — On an Android phone in Chrome, on the dev loop, play two films partway and leave
  each. Open the home screen (Films): **Continue watching** shows both, the last watched first,
  each with how far along it is, and touching one plays it from where it was left. Press **Hide**
  on one: it goes, with **Undo**, which brings it back. Hide it again and play it a little: it is
  back by itself. The row scrolls sideways and fits the phone's width.
  (`web/apps/web/src/continue-watching.tsx`) — done 2026-09-26 by the owner, on an
  Android phone in Chrome: *"Browser test on Android worked fine. With 3 partially viewed films
  the row showed a scroll bar that matched the width, so all looks good."*
- [x] **VQ6** — On an Android phone in Chrome, on the dev loop, play **Remux Film (2021)**,
  choose **Spanish** under **Subtitles**, and leave. Play it again: Spanish is chosen and drawn
  from the start. Choose **Off**, leave, and play it again: subtitles are off. Then switch apps for
  a while and come back: after the page reloads, the choice is still there.
  (`web/apps/web/src/subtitles.tsx`) — done 2026-09-26 by the owner, on an
  Android phone in Chrome: *"Verified on the phone."*
- [ ] **VQ7** — On the dev loop, as owner on a computer, open **People**, add a person, and send
  the link shown to an Android phone. On the phone, open it: choose a password, and it signs in.
  On the phone, open **Your account**, name a device and make a code. On a television's browser
  (or a second browser), open the server, choose **I have a code**, and type the code in capitals
  with a space for the dash: it signs in as that person. The code does not work a second time.
  Back on the computer, **New link** for the person, and the old link no longer works. On the
  phone, **Your devices** lists the phone and the television; while a code is showing, let the
  phone sleep and wake it: the code is still there. **Remove** the television: its next page
  load asks it to sign in.
  (`web/apps/web/src/people.tsx`, `register.tsx`, `code-sign-in.tsx`, `account.tsx`)
- [x] **VQ8** — On the dev loop, on the Android phone, play a film: before it plays, it asks how
  the device plays sound. Choose **Headphones**; a film with 5.1 sound then plays through a
  prepared copy, saying the device plays stereo, with the **Dialogue boost** switch. Turn the
  boost on, go back, and play another 5.1 film: the switch starts on, and the voices are raised.
  Under the video, **Change** the sound to **Soundbar or receiver**: a film the browser can
  play plays as it is, with no switch; one prepared for its container or sound (an MKV, TrueHD)
  keeps the switch, and the boost works on it. In **Your account**, the device's sound shows the same and can be changed there
  (D222). (`web/apps/web/src/sound.tsx`, `play.tsx`, `your-devices.tsx`) — done 2026-09-27 by
  the owner, on an Android phone: *"Everything works as expected. when I select sound bar, I
  still see the dialogue boost button, and it boosts the channel"*; the receiver step was
  corrected to that (A11), and the owner kept the switch: *"Yes we keep the switch"*.
- [ ] **VQ9** — On devnas, with Landlock switched on at boot (`cat /sys/kernel/security/lsm` lists
  `landlock`), run `go test ./internal/node/confine/ -run TestEscape -v` from the tree: both
  escape tests pass, and neither is skipped. Then start the node there and open **System**:
  it says FFmpeg runs in its sandbox on devnas, and doctor's confinement
  finding is ok. M3's acceptance asks for the escape test green on devnas (cut-a §8, D112).
  (`internal/node/confine/`)
- [ ] **VQ10** — On devnas, start the node and open **System**, as admin. Under the machine,
  **Hardware encoding** says video is encoded on the GPU with Intel Quick Sync; **What it sees**
  lists `/dev/dri/renderD128` with its driver (i915 or xe) and says the server may open it; the
  Quick Sync trial worked, and doctor's hardware finding is OK. Play a film whose video the
  browser cannot play (HEVC 10-bit on a phone): it prepares and plays, `intel_gpu_top` shows the
  video engine busy meanwhile, and afterwards **Recent prepared copies** lists it made with Intel
  Quick Sync, faster than real time. With Landlock on (VQ9), all of it holds: the GPU is granted
  to the confined encode (cut-a §6, D225). (`internal/node/prepare/encoder.go`,
  `internal/node/hardware/`, `internal/node/confine/landlock_linux.go`,
  `web/apps/web/src/system.tsx`)
- [ ] **VQ11** — On the dev loop, as admin, open **Settings** and set the OpenSubtitles username
  and password. Play a film that has no German subtitles, and under the video choose **Find
  subtitles…**, pick German and **Search OpenSubtitles**: it says how many of the day's downloads
  are left (20 on a free account), says none is checked against the sound, and lists what
  OpenSubtitles has, a copy **made for this very file** first when there is one. **Download** one:
  the film plays again with it chosen, named "downloaded, unverified" in the menu, and the count
  is one lower next time. **Earlier**/**Later** move it. Play the film again: it starts with that
  subtitle. Set a wrong password: the search says OpenSubtitles refused the login.
  (`internal/core/providers/opensubtitles/`, `web/apps/web/src/subtitle-search.tsx`, D224)
- [x] **VQ12** — On the dev loop, on the Mac, in Chrome and then in Safari: play *Wing*
  (director's cut) from the real films (`/play/42`) and then *Back to the Lantern* (`/play/59`),
  once both are measured (the job view lists `measure_loudness` jobs until then). Under the video,
  **Level loudness** is on and says Wing is raised about 13 dB; with the volume untouched, the
  two play at about the same level, and Wing's dialogue is clear with the Mac's volume where it
  is for other films. Turn **Level loudness** off: Wing is quiet again at once, and the note says
  it plays as it was mixed; reload, and it stays off. Turn it back on. Play a film whose sound is
  prepared (one with 5.1 sound, on built-in speakers): it is levelled too, and switching the dialogue
  boost changes the voices, not the whole film's level (D226).
  (`web/packages/player/src/gain.ts`, `web/apps/web/src/levelling.tsx`,
  `internal/core/playback/loudness.go`) — done 2026-09-29 by the owner, on the Mac: *"Loudness
  works fine in chrome and safari"*.
- [ ] **VQ13** — On an iPhone, in Safari: play a measured film that plays directly, with the ring
  switch on silent: it plays with sound, and the note says this device sets its own volume. Play
  a measured film that is prepared after it was measured: it plays levelled (D226 §4).

- [ ] **VQ14** — On an iPhone, in Safari, on the dev loop after `make dev-reset`: play
  **TrueHD Film (2022)** (H.264 with TrueHD, so it is prepared on play), then **Remux Film (2021)**
  and choose **English** under **Subtitles** (its ASS track). Passes when each film's picture
  moves within 8 s of pressing play, the reason it is not played directly is on screen, and the
  ASS text appears over the picture. The dev library has no one file with H.264, TrueHD and ASS
  together; `web/e2e/play-timing.spec.ts` checks that file in Chromium and Firefox, and this item
  is its iPhone Safari half (cut-a §8, M3's acceptance). (`web/packages/player/`)
- [ ] **VQ15** — On the Mac, with Apple's HTTP Live Streaming tools installed: once VQ14 has
  prepared **TrueHD Film (2022)**, copy the rendition's directory (the one holding
  `master.m3u8` under `.dev/cache/prepared/`) to the Mac and run
  `mediastreamvalidator master.m3u8` in it. Passes when it reports no errors (cut-a §8, M3's
  acceptance: `mediastreamvalidator` passes on a prepared rendition).
  (`internal/node/prepare/arguments.go`)
- [ ] **VQ16** — On devnas (Debian trixie), as your own user: install Docker Engine from Docker's
  Debian repository and add yourself to the `docker` group, clone the repository, and run `./dev
  make check`. Passes when the first run builds the development image (`deploy/dev.Containerfile`)
  without an error and the gate passes inside it. Then run `ORPHEUM_DEV_PUBLISH=0.0.0.0 ./dev make
  dev` and open `http://<devnas's LAN address>:5173` from another machine's browser: passes when the
  dev library appears and a title plays. Also check that nothing but the clone changed on the host:
  `docker volume ls` shows the `orpheum-dev-*` volumes, and no Go, Node or FFmpeg was installed
  outside Docker. The launcher and the image were written in a sandbox without a container engine
  and have never been built or run
  ([D235](decisions/working-notes.md#d235--development-and-deployment-run-in-containers-one-image-family-one-command-each-built-by-goreleaser)
  §3). (`./dev`, `deploy/dev.Containerfile`)

- [ ] **VQ17** — On devnas, after `./dev --stop` and `ORPHEUM_DEV_PUBLISH=0.0.0.0 ./dev make dev`
  with `ORPHEUM_DEV_MEDIA` on `/tank`: the core's log line `a node said hello` lists its
  `devices`. Passes when the media root's device is `zfs:tank`, its `disks` are the pool's data
  disks, and its `kind` is `spinning` (or `ssd` when every disk of the pool is one), and the
  `.dev` directories' device is the disk the clone is on, of kind `unknown` when it is behind USB
  and udev read no rotation rate from it (seen 2026-10-03: the USB SSD `sdc` was called spinning,
  the kernel's guess through its bridge, before that was set aside). The pool is followed to its disks through
  the host's `/run/udev`, which `./dev` mounts read-only into the container; no ZFS was at hand
  where this was written ([D240](decisions/working-notes.md#d240--the-core-keeps-the-smarts-a-scan-is-a-listing-the-core-compares-the-work-it-implies-is-the-cores-to-schedule-and-the-node-enforces-its-devices-limits-and-pauses-background-work-for-play) §5).
