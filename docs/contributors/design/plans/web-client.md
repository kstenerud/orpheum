# Web client

- **Status:** PLANNED — designed 2026-09-17.
- **Depends on:** stream-service.md

## Scope

The shared SDK first (generated from the server's OpenAPI document, plus the hand-written
probe-and-pick logic that implements D2 once for everyone), then the web UI on top of it:
library browsing, search, playback with `hls.js` + `jassub`, and the admin surface.

## Why the SDK is the deliverable

D2 puts the rendition choice on the client. That is only safe if the choice is implemented
**once**, correctly, and shared — otherwise every client picks badly in its own way. The SDK is
where `navigator.mediaCapabilities.decodingInfo()` and its per-platform equivalents get turned
into a rendition preference.

## Non-negotiables

Subtitle offset control; manual override of the playback decision; a visible "why is this
transcoding?"; trickplay scrub previews; resume correct to the second.
