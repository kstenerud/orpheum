// Package library is the library model: Title, Edition, Version and File, extras, collections, and
// what the scanner saw. It ingests the node's reports, gives every observed file a filing with a
// reason, and serves browse and search. Identity is the media payload hash, not the path or the
// bytes.
//
// # Invariants
//
//   - Imports nothing from internal/node, never os/exec, and no image or media parser. Enforced by
//     the depguard rule core-boundary, and transitively by TestArch_CoreNeverImportsNode and
//     TestArch_CoreNeverExecs.
//   - Opens no file and walks no directory; files are internal/core/datadir's. Enforced by the
//     forbidigo rule tagged [core-fs].
//   - Imports no database/sql or SQLite driver; it calls internal/store. Enforced by the depguard
//     rule sql-only-in-store and TestArch_OnlyStoreImportsDatabaseSQL.
//   - Never opens a media path; it knows files only from node reports. Enforced by the forbidigo
//     rule tagged [core-fs]; M2's test runs the core with the media root unreadable to it.
//   - Every path a scan enumerated has a row with its filing and reason (D163).
//     TestIngest_EveryEnumeratedPathGetsARowWithItsFilingAndReason.
//   - A file is matched by its payload hash: seen again, moved (its row follows it), replaced
//     (the old row tombstoned, D173) or new (D179). TestIngest_D179MatchesAFileByItsPayloadWhereverItIs.
//   - A copy is a duplicate, and the recorded path keeps the identity (D179).
//     TestIngest_ACopyIsADuplicateAndTheRecordedPathKeepsTheIdentity.
//   - Only a completed scan tombstones, never inside a region it could not read, and it records
//     the root as scanned in the same transaction (D39, D40, schema.md root_scan).
//     TestIngest_OnlyACompletedScanRemovesAndNeverWhereItCouldNotRead.
//   - Paths are stored in NFC beside their bytes (D49). TestIngest_APathIsStoredInNFCBesideItsBytes.
//   - A clean scan of an unplugged disk's empty mount point removes nothing: a changed device or
//     mount, or a removal of all of a root's files or more than half and more than twenty, waits
//     for the admin (D41, D208 §3). TestScenario_S7_S8_AnUnpluggedDiskRemovesNothingAndItsReturnRestoresEverything,
//     TestScenario_S7_RemovalsPastTheThresholdWaitAndFewerGoAhead.
//   - A disk missing from a mount point inside a root — found by comparing the mount boundaries a
//     scan crossed with the last complete scan's — removes nothing under it (D208, as corrected).
//     TestScenario_S7b_ADiskUnpluggedInsideARootRemovesNothingUnderIt.
//   - A sidecar is filed as attached to the video it belongs to, and an NFO's bytes are stored as
//     identification's input (D182). TestIngest_ASidecarIsAttachedToTheVideoItBelongsTo.
//   - A payload that returns revives its tombstone, with its history (D208 §4).
//   - Once a scan's end is committed its library is handed on, to identification.
//     TestIngest_AfterAScanEndsItsLibraryIsHandedOn.
//   - A library covers only roots its node configured, as the node's hello named them (D107);
//     creating one scans it. TestAdmin_CreatesALibraryOverTheNodesRootsAndScansIt.
//     TestScenario_S10_AFilmPutBackRevivesItsTombstone.
//
// # Read before changing
//
//   - D79: four levels, Title, Edition, Version, File.
//   - D163: every observed file carries a filing with a reason.
//   - D173: a replaced file is a deletion and an addition; tombstones, not deletes.
//   - D179: a file's identity is a hash of its media payload.
//   - D42: nodes are sensors; the core is the only thing that decides.
//   - docs/contributors/design/plans/library-model.md, docs/contributors/design/plans/scanner.md.
//
// # Where to change
//
//   - ingest.go, observe.go, complete.go, sidecar.go: the report ingest; streams.go: the stream rows a probe
//     derives; create.go: libraries; admin.go: what an admin does with them (create over a node's
//     roots, list, scan, the scanner view). Browse and search come later in M2.
